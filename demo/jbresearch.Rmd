## Motivation

  * It's not only __reprodicibility__ per se, it is also 
    - personal effectiveness
    - automation
    - ease of maintenance and readability
    - avoiding redundancy and inconsistency
  * Downsides: cognitive effort, need to learn new tools, maintenance cost
  * Main source of inspiration: _[Reproducible Research with R and R Studio, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Reproducible-Research-Studio-Second-Chapman/dp/1498715370)_ by Christopher Gandrud

## The big picture

  1. __Gather__
    * Interact with APIs, scrap web pages
    * Store data
  2. __Process__
    * Clean data, perform auxiliary transformations
    * Aggregate key aspects of interest
  3. __Analyze__ 
    * Gather statistics, build models
    * Visualize
  4. __Present__
    * Report findings, provide access to wide audience
    * Preserve project for future use

## Key solutions (overview)

  * Folder/file structure
  * Version control
  * R, RStudio and rmarkdown
  * Output file formats
  * GNU Make
  * Docker
  * Interacting with Google docs
  
## Folder/file structure

  * Each research step is physically separated
  * Each step contains only relevant data, code and packages
  * Folder structure is standardized, e.g. `read.csv("raw_data/")` + TAB
  * (Almost) all paths are relative, not absolute
  * Research types can be templated
  * Folders for supplementary materials

## Version control

  * ... is it self-evident?
  * De-facto standard in development, rising in research
  * RStudio and github integration
  * Commit as a trigger for build, a self-sufficient unit of change
  * Better suited for automated builds (compared to cloud file storage or GDoc)
  * Better for security, maintenance and control
  
## R ecosystem

  * R provides extensive data access capabilities:
    - database interaction (MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, ...)
    - APIs interfaces (WebTechnologies task view)
    - GDocs
  * R packages -- sustainable way of sharing reusable code
  * Package infrastructure 
  
## R Markdown

  * An infrastructure to convert rich text and embed R code results into multiple formats
  * Reports are always consistent with data and code
  * Caching saves time (careful about possible invalidation though)
  * `.Rmd` is processed into `.md` via `knitr`
  * `.md` is processed into final formats via `pandoc`
  * MOOCs: [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-with-r-markdown), [Stepik](https://stepik.org/course/724) (in Russian) 

## Output file formats

  * Standard triple: HTML, DOCX, PDF
  * Settings are stored independently for each format in YAML header
  * Style options available: 
    - CSS for HTML
    - reference styles for DOCX
    - full LATEX support for PDF

## GNU Make

  * A command line utility for automated builds
  * Syntax:

        target: dependencies ...
                commands
                ...
                
  * Target updates iff any dependency updates
  * Use bash, R, python, ... -- anything available from shell!
  * Define multiple scenarios

## Docker 

  * Classic situation: each researcher has his own dynamic environment
  * With docker, research process is integrated with environment (OS kernel, dependencies, R version, package versions, etc.)
  * Relevant docker images:
    - `r-base`
    - `rocker/rstudio` (base + RStudio)
    - `rocker/tidyverse` (base + RStudio + package collection)
    - `rocker/verse` (base + RStudio + package collection + TEX)
    - see full list at https://hub.docker.com/u/rocker/

## Interacting with GDocs

  * Existing R packages: `RGoogleDocs`, `RGoogleData`, `googlesheets`
  * A better (IMO) alternative: `gdrive`, a command line utility
  * Allows import, export, synchronization, supports revisions
  * Requires manual installation and access token (can be automated)
  
## Other ideas and concepts to consider

  * CRAN snapshots, package tree management: `checkpoint`, `miniCRAN` packages
  * "Reversing" GDocs to Rmds: `gdocs2Rmd` package
  * ROpenSci community: http://ropensci.org/
  * R Markdown custom formats
  * Travis CI, GitLab pipelines
